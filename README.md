Overview of the school district analysis
Maria, the Chief Data Scientist for a School District, is responsible for analyzing school data. Her analysis helps to make strategic decisions. This summary was done to present to the School Board. 

The report contains the following sections: 
  * District Summary
  * School Summary
  * Top & Bottom Five schools by the overall Passing percentage
  * Math and Reading Scores by Grade
  * Scores by School Spending per capita 
  * Scores by School Population Size
  * Scores by School Type
 
_Note:_ Due to an issue with the reading and math grades for Thomas High School (THS) ninth graders were replaced with NaN. This analysis was done by a second time impacting some scores. 


### Results
As the issue impacts the summary, it is considered to resolve the following questions to avoid any misunderstanding.
The student total is 39,170, THS 9th students are 461. When the grades were substracted from the total the math and reading scores were affected. 

  - *How is the district summary affected?* 
  As you can see in the following images, the Passing Math and Reading Percentage were affected, also the Overall Percentage due to subtracting from the total population, the THS 9th-grade.
